# Bankist Application

Welcome to the Bankist Application! This fictional application is designed to provide a simulated banking experience. Please note that Bankist is not a real bank and does not handle real money transactions.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Users can create and manage their fictional bank accounts, including savings, checking, and investment accounts. They can view their balances in their local currency based on the locale of their browser. The application also displays the account information, such as the total amount that has come in, the amount that has left the account, and the accrued interest.

- **Localization and Personalization**: Bankist detects the locale and language settings of the user's browser. It automatically adjusts the currency and language displayed in the application to provide a personalized experience.

- **Borrowing Money**: Users can apply for fictional loans and borrow money directly through the Bankist Application. The application provides information on interest rates, repayment terms, and calculates fictional monthly installment amounts based on the loan amount and duration.

- **Sending Money**: Bankist allows users to send fictional money to other users within the application. Users can easily select recipients from their contact list and specify the amount to transfer. The application provides real-time transaction updates and confirmation notifications.

- **Account Deletion**: Users have the option to delete their fictional accounts if they no longer wish to use Bankist. The application guides users through the account deletion process and ensures that all necessary precautions are taken to secure their data.

- **Automatic Logout**: To ensure security, Bankist automatically logs out users after 2 minutes of inactivity. This feature helps protect user accounts in case of unintended access or forgetting to manually log out.
